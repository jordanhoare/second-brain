**capitalism with a social contract**

Economists and political theorists usually define #capitalism by three baseline features:
1. **Private ownership** of the means of production (factories, tools, capital goods)
2. **Markets and prices** as the primary mechanism for allocating goods, labour, and capital
3. **Wage labour** — people sell their labour to earn income
4. **Profit motive** — investment and innovation are driven by private return

**The Nordic model and the Australian model are both capitalist systems** — what differs is **how much** and **how well** the state intervenes in key social sectors, **not whether** it intervenes.

- Are capitalist — private ownership, markets, wage labour, and profit-seeking firms dominate the economy
- Have state involvement in healthcare, education, and welfare
- Use taxation and public spending as tools to address social needs

If you're thinking about governance as "what should be left to the market vs what should be socialised", then both models draw the line in the same places, but apply different philosophies to manage those areas.
