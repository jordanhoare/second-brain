**capitalism with a social contract**

Economists and political theorists usually define #capitalism by three baseline features:
1. **Private ownership** of the means of production (factories, tools, capital goods)
2. **Markets and prices** as the primary mechanism for allocating goods, labour, and capital
3. **Wage labour** — people sell their labour to earn income
4. **Profit motive** — investment and innovation are driven by private return

**The Nordic model and the Australian model are both capitalist systems** — what differs is **how much** and **how well** the state intervenes in key social sectors, **not whether** it intervenes.

- Are capitalist — private ownership, markets, wage labour, and profit-seeking firms dominate the economy
- Have state involvement in healthcare, education, and welfare
- Use taxation and public spending as tools to address social needs

If you're thinking about governance as "what should be left to the market vs what should be socialised", then both models draw the line in the same places, but apply different philosophies to manage those areas.

Australia’s Sovereign Wealth Fund: Similar in Form, Different in Function

Australia operates a sovereign wealth fund known as the Future Fund, established in 2006 to help cover the government’s unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. While professionally managed and independently governed, its scope is relatively narrow. It is not funded by resource revenues, nor is it used to support public services, infrastructure, or macroeconomic stability. Withdrawals are strictly limited and not integrated into the federal budget.

In contrast, Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) is designed as a comprehensive fiscal tool. It is funded by oil and gas revenues and supports the national budget directly, with up to 3% of the fund’s value drawn annually for public spending. It serves as both a stabilisation mechanism and a vehicle for intergenerational equity, underpinning Norway’s broader social-democratic model.

Although both countries maintain sovereign wealth funds, Australia’s is significantly smaller in scale and more limited in function, reflecting different policy objectives and fiscal strategies.




I'm struggling to understand whether it is only heavier taxation that allows more universally available services in the nordic model versus somewhere like the USA.  For example, if the taxes and VAT was higher in the USA, would the government theoretically have enough money to fund things like free healthcare, education and welfare similar to the nordic model?  Or are there other very large factors that prevent this?  I.e.  the goods the USA produces means the overall collection of taxes and income of the government would be significantly lower per capita for the USA. 

For a country like Australia, what would be the key policy changes that would


Features of the Nordic model include the public provision of social services, investment in services associated with human capital, and a strong social safety net. Society-wide risk sharing is a cardinal component of the Nordic model.



Australia lacks a dense base of globally competitive, high-margin firms that can easily absorb higher payroll taxes or inflationary wage pressures.



Politically, left. Economically, right.

Let me elaborate. Politically, you would find the Nordic countries to the left when you compare to the United States. High taxes, long, paid maternity and paternity leaves, free college and healthcare, subsidized childcare etc. However, this also goes for large parts of Europe.

Economically, however, the Nordic countries are actually more capitalist than the United States. The government doesn't set any minimum wage, it leaves that to the labout market. Banks are less regulated, we have more corporations per capita and ranks higher in innovation indexes. The taxes are flatter, and at least in Sweden we have no property taxes or inheritance taxes and capital gains taxes are lower. When industries goes belly up due to foreign competition, the government stays out (R.I.P. SAAB Automotive).
