The [[swf - Future Fund]], Australiaâ€™s sovereign wealth vehicle, is valued at A$304.5 billion but is not resourced from mining or energy revenues. ([source](https://www.futurefund.gov.au/investment-performance))

A resource-based sovereign wealth fund would provide:
- A **buffer against commodity price fluctuations** that periodically destabilise Australia's economy and government revenues.
- Protection against "**Dutch disease**" effects when booming resource exports drive up the dollar and harm other export sectors.
- **Transformation of temporary resource wealth into permanent financial assets** that benefit future generations of Australians.
- **Long-term financial security** without requiring excessive taxation as resource revenues decline in the future.
