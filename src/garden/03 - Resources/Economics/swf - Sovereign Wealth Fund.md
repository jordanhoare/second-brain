>A sovereign wealth fund (SWF) is a state-owned investment fund comprised of money generated by the government, often derived from a country's surplus reserves. SWFs provide a benefit for a country's economy and its citizens.

An SWF is typically:
- Owned and managed by the national government
- Invested in real or financial assets (domestically or globally)
- Designed for macroeconomic, fiscal, or strategic purposes

Australia operates a sovereign wealth fund known as the Future Fund, established in 2006 to help cover the government’s unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities. While professionally managed and independently governed, its scope is relatively narrow. It is **not funded by resource revenues**, nor is it used to support public services, infrastructure, or macroeconomic stability. 

Another, often considered the "best" sovereign wealth fund example in the world,is  Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) which is designed as a comprehensive fiscal tool. It is funded by oil and gas revenues and supports the national budget directly, with up to 3% of the fund’s value drawn annually for public spending. It serves as both a stabilisation mechanism and a vehicle for intergenerational equity.
