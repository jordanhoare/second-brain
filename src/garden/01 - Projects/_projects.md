# Projects

This section contains ongoing and completed projects, both professional and personal. Each project has its own set of notes, reflections, and resources.

## Active Projects

- [[sb - Second Brain]]: design decisions for my writing, note taking and knowledge system
- [[tibia - Mythbound]]: 
- [[tibia - Aincrad]]: 
- [[lab - Homelab]]: 
- [[tb - Dotfiles]]: 

## Project Methodology

I approach projects with a combination of:

- Regular reflection and iteration
- Documentation of learning throughout
- Connecting project insights to my broader knowledge base

Each project page includes resources, key learnings, and links to related atomic notes that emerged during the work.
