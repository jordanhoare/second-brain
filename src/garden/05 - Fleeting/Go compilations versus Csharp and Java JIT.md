Beyond the intended use (i.e.: Go for systems programming) why was the JIT used?  Given C# and Java are considered 'lower-level', they don't seem far from dynamic interpreted languages with bytecode execution (given they follow the same compilation model with a JIT machine code compilation/execution?)

Is Go's implementation a more modern approach to newer languages where support for multiple operating systems is more readily available?

What does the JIT compilers and JVM do that CPython can't?
