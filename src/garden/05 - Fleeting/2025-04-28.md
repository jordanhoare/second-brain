combination of the zettelkasten and para methods for notetaking
- fleeting notes: high level ideas, used later to continue
- literature notes: external ideas from others
- permanent notes:  more refined versions of fleeting and literature, and linking them with obsidian etc..

para method:
- projects: short term project with due date etc..
- areas: wider than projects, more general that are ongoing
- resources: resources are references of other peoples works that are inspiring work i'm doing
- archives:  completed projects or things no longer actively being worked on
