> [!quote]  Schopenhauer
> But when some external cause or inward disposition lifts us suddenly out of the endless stream of willing,—delivers knowledge from the slavery of the will,—the attention is no longer directed to the motives of willing, but comprehends things free from their relation to the will; and thus observes them without personal interest, without subjectivity, purely objectively,—gives itself entirely up to them so far as they are ideas, but not in so far as they are motives. Then all at once the peace which we were always seeking, but which always fled from us on the former path of the desires, comes to us of its own accord; and it is well with us. It is the painless state which Epicurus prized as the highest good and as the state of the gods: for we are for the moment set free from the miserable striving of the will ...

More recently I have been absorbed in the #homelab and #personal-project experience. Even in my professional work with #python, #typescript, and cloud platforms like #aws, #azure & #gcp, I find myself consistently drawn to the question: _what is happening under the hood?_

While these high-level languages and services offer tremendous value through abstraction, my mind inevitably wanders deeper. When deploying code to the cloud, I'm compelled to understand:

- What physical or virtual server is hosting my build process?
- Through what mechanisms does the cloud service access and deploy my package?
- Why was this particular architectural approach chosen among alternatives?
- What underlying hardware actually executes my code, and what makes it secure?

This persistent curiosity drives me to #bootstrap personal projects from #first-principles. Instead of merely consuming services like #kafka, #pyspark, or #kubernetes as pre-packaged solutions, I build them on #baremetal or VMs from scratch—configuring the daemons & networking, compiling source code, and exploring the internal APIs that power these systems.

Viewed through Schopenhauer's ideas, this pattern of behaviour reveals a another dimension or angel in my technical explorations. What I experience in these deep dives is precisely what he described as **"aesthetic contemplation as an escape from the will."** 

Modern technology stacks, with all their layers of abstraction and convenience, embodies what Schopenhauer may have recognised as manifestation of the "will" - our relentless drive for efficiency and utility.

The homelab experiment offers what Schopenhauer considered **"one of the few genuine reprieves from suffering"** - moments of focused engagement where we can transcend everyday concerns. 

When tracing a Python function through it's #abstractsyntaxtree, or manually configuring a distributed system from core components, instead of just 'drawing a line', I'm no longer serving the will's demands for practical outcomes. Instead, I enter a contemplative state where understanding becomes its own reward.

I imagine Schopenhauer would recognise my compulsion to look beneath #abstractions as fundamentally philosophical. When I read documentation on AWS services to understand their implementations a bit more, replicate a new container stack with all it's components decoupled, or even explore how the an async queue in Postgres works - I'm peeling back what he termed the "veil of Maya"... looking beyond appearances (convenient APIs) to glimpse underlying reality. The satisfaction in doing so isn't merely intellectual curiosity; it's sort of a temporary liberation from what Schopenhauer termed "the tyranny of the will." 

This explains why I've come to identify so deeply with homelab and personal project pursuits. They represent not just a hobby but a philosophical practice - moments when intense focus and the desire for learning and understanding provide a freedom from practical demands. 

In building from bare metal, I discover not just technical knowledge but the liberation that comes when stepping outside the stream of wanting to become, as Schopenhauer would say, a "pure, will-less subject of knowledge."

Through this lens, my technical curiosity transforms from a personality quirt into a meaningful philosophical journey - one where each layer of abstraction peeled away brings not just understanding of technology, but moments of genuine freedom that Schopenhauer understood as essential to human experience.
