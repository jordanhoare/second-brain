# My Core Values

I've been thinking about what really matters to me. What guides how I make decisions and why I react the way I do to certain situations. That Nietzsche quote really hits home for me - the struggle of staying true to yourself even when it's harder than just going along with everyone else.

## Craftsmanship & Growth Through Challenge

I find myself drawn to projects that initially seem beyond my abilities. There's something deeply fulfilling about starting something despite knowing I don't yet have all the skills needed. I trust my capacity to learn and overcome obstacles along the way. Unlike many who abandon difficult endeavours when the learning curve steepens, I derive satisfaction from persisting through uncertainty. The quality of my work matters tremendously to me—not just the completion itself, but ensuring that whatever I create represents my best effort and capabilities, even when those capabilities are developed during the process. This trust in my ability to grow through challenge defines much of how I approach both work and personal projects.

## Integrity & Trustworthiness

I've learned through experience how important it is to honour the trust others place in me. When I've slipped up in the past, the feeling of having failed someone's confidence affected me deeply. I value being the kind of person who keeps their word and maintains confidences, even when it would be easier not to. Being trustworthy isn't just about my reputation with others - it's about being able to respect myself.

## Discipline & Intentionality

Early mornings have become a cornerstone of my well-being. The quiet hours before dawn provide me with space for mindfulness and intentional living. Moving through a structured routine without technological or social distractions helps ground me and prepares me mentally for whatever the day holds. This discipline isn't about rigid adherence to rules but about creating space for what matters most to me and giving me a chance to reflect... to feel grounded in who I am and what I want to do every day I wake up.

## Personal Responsibility & Self-reliance

I believe strongly in taking ownership of my circumstances and choices. It frustrates me to see people avoid accountability or continually complain without taking steps to address their situations. Being self-reliant gives me confidence and peace of mind, knowing I can navigate life's challenges independently when needed. This doesn't mean refusing support, but rather approaching life with an internal locus of control.

## Professional & Personal Honesty

I value transparency about what quality work truly requires. Cutting corners or misrepresenting the time and effort needed to do something well feels fundamentally dishonest to me. I prefer facing difficult truths about project requirements rather than compromising on standards. This sometimes creates tension in professional settings, but maintaining this integrity is non-negotiable for my sense of professional and personally ethics.

## Authentic Presence

Being fully engaged in whatever I'm doing matters deeply to me. Whether in conversation, work, or personal time, I value giving my complete attention rather than being mentally scattered. Mindfulness practices help me cultivate this quality of presence, which enriches my experience of everyday moments and strengthens my connections with others.  In the past I've often found if I don't have a sense of intentionality and self-disciple in my day to day life, that this slips - and I often reflect and feel horrible that I haven't provided others a space that I'd like myself to experience.

## Individualism

I'm comfortable forging my own path, even when it diverges from conventional wisdom or group consensus. There's a certain energy I derive from independently arriving at my own conclusions and learning through direct experience. While I value input from those I trust, I ultimately believe in the importance of making choices that align with my own understanding rather than defaulting to external expectations or norms.

## Open Family Relationships

The depth of my connection with family members, particularly my mother, is something I cherish profoundly. Unlike many who maintain emotional distance from family, I find value in sharing my innermost thoughts and feelings with those closest to me. This openness isn't vulnerability but strength—a willingness to be fully known by those I trust most. My introspective nature and comfort with emotional expression create bonds of unusual depth and authenticity in my closest relationships.

## Order & Environmental Clarity

I place significant value on maintaining clean, orderly spaces. The state of my physical environment directly affects my mental state and ability to function effectively. I believe that the discipline required to keep one's immediate surroundings in order is foundational to achieving larger goals—if I can't maintain order in my personal space, how can I expect to create order in more complex aspects of life? This isn't merely about aesthetics but reflects a deeper belief that external order facilitates internal clarity.

Looking at these values helps me understand myself better. They show up in how I act, what upsets me, and what makes me feel fulfilled. Now I can be more intentional about living according to what truly matters to me.
