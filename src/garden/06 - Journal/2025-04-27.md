> [!quote] Freud
> It sounds like a fairy-tale, but not only that; this story of what man by his science and practical inventions has achieved on this earth, where he first appeared as a weakly member of the animal kingdom, and on which each individual of his species must ever again appear as a helpless infant... is a direct fulfilment of all, or of most, of the dearest wishes in his fairy-tales. All these possessions he has acquired through culture. Long ago he formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. Whatever seemed unattainable to his desires - or forbidden to him - he attributed to these gods. One may say, therefore, that these gods were the ideals of his culture. Now he has himself approached very near to realising this ideal, he has nearly become a god himself. But only, it is true, in the way that ideals are usually realised in the general experience of humanity. Not completely; in some respects not at all, in others only by halves. **Man has become a god by means of artificial limbs, so to speak, quite magnificent when equipped with all his accessory organs; but they do not grow on him and they still give him trouble at times...** Future ages will produce further great advances in this realm of culture, probably inconceivable now, and will increase man's likeness to a god still more.”

It seems like a re-occurring theme this week... contemplation on consumption culture, dopamine-seeking behaviour, and the irony of self-improvement - albeit different lenses.

We seek constant stimulation and growth while ignoring our fundamental nature and mortality.. Freud's observation that humanity has "become a god by means of artificial limbs" feels eerily prescient in our digital age. We've extended our reach through technology to fulfil "the dearest wishes in fairy-tales"—instant communication, vast knowledge at our fingertips, entertainment on demand. Yet as Freud notes, these accessories "do not grow on him and they still give him trouble at times."

Perhaps boredom is that trouble—the friction that arises when our godlike extensions fail to satisfy something essential in our human nature. We can summon endless stimulation, yet find ourselves increasingly restless, constantly seeking the next dopamine hit, the next self-improvement technique.  

Boredom has become something to be feared, avoided at all costs—as if sitting with one's own unoccupied mind is some kind of failure. Every moment must be optimised, filled with content, information, stimulation. Yet in these deliberate moments of emptiness, something unexpected emerges. The quiet mind doesn't remain empty for long; it fills with thoughts that feel more original, more genuine than the recycled ideas we constantly consume.  The mind when not stimulated doesn't just shut down - it opens up.  

I'm finding that simplicity works well because it acknowledges the limits of our artificial godhood. The mind, when temporarily disconnected from its extensions, reconnects with something more essential. This reconnection doesn't reject cultural advancement but seeks a more balanced relationship with it—one that honors both our technological achievements and the embodied humanity they're meant to serve.

There is a certain motivation that comes from this space too.  Work that follows from this kind of motivation feels a little less depleting and more sustainable.
