Democracy refers to a system of government where power ultimately resides with citizens, typically exercised through voting, elections, and representative institutions. 

As a political concept, it addresses fundamental questions about the organisation of power, legitimacy of rule, representation, and governance structures.

Democracy implies certain ethical positions about equality, fairness, and the moral standing of citizens. The principle that people should have a say in decisions affecting them has ethical foundations.

Democracy involves theories about the proper relationship between individuals and their communities, addressing how collective decisions should be made.
