English #philosopher and #physician, widely regarded as one of the most influential #Enlightenment thinkers and the "Father of Liberalism." 

Locke's political philosophy centred on natural rights, the social contract, and limited government.

In his **Two Treatises of Government** (1689), Locke articulated core classical liberal principles:
- Humans possess natural rights to life, liberty, and property
- Government derives legitimacy from the consent of the governed
- Government's primary purpose is to protect natural rights
- Citizens have the right to rebel against governments that fail this purpose

Locke's **Letter Concerning Toleration** (1689) advocated for religious freedom and separation of church and state, establishing another pillar of liberal thought.

His focus on property rights and individual freedom from interference established much of the tenant of negative liberty in liberalism. 

Locke's ideas heavily influenced the American and French revolutions, and his conception of natural rights shapes liberal democratic governance to this day.
