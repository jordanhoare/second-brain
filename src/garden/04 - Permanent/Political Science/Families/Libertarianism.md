Libertarianism serves as a radical extension of #classical-liberalism that seeks to minimise or eliminate #state-power in favour of individual #sovereignty. It places absolute primacy on #individual-liberty and views the state primarily as a threat to freedom.

## Key Principles
- Complete self-ownership and strong property rights
- Non-aggression principle: initiating force against others is illegitimate
- Minimal ( #minarchism or #night-watch-state) or non-existent state ( #anarcho-capitalism)
- Unregulated free markets with no government intervention
- All human relationships should be voluntary and consensual

While no nation fully embodies libertarian principles, the United States offers the closest approximation through its constitutional limitations on government, strong emphasis on property rights, and significant libertarian intellectual infrastructure. However, its extensive welfare state, high taxation, economic regulations, and restrictions on personal freedom demonstrate the limits of libertarian influence in practice.
