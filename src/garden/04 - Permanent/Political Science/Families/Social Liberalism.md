A branch of #liberalism that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to the social problems created by industrial [[Capitalism]]. Social liberalism maintains commitment to individual freedom while recognising that true liberty requires certain material and social conditions.

Social liberalism provided the philosophical foundation for welfare state policies in many Western democracies during the 20th century. It attempts to reconcile liberal commitments to individual freedom with social democratic concerns for economic justice and equality.

## Principles:
- Positive conception of liberty (freedom to develop one's capacities)
- Recognition that poverty and inequality can restrict meaningful freedom
- Support for social welfare programs, public education, healthcare access
- Belief that government intervention can enhance rather than threaten liberty
- Commitment to equality of opportunity
