title: Liberalism
---
#liberalism is committed to providing the maximum #freedom for #individuals.  The fact that different understandings of freedom are available, though, means that this statement is only the starting point for an understanding of liberalism.  

Liberalism has been articulated many ways since the 17th century. The varying circumstances and conditions of a period vastly affected the ongoing development and application of liberalism thought - and has led many branches of liberalism thought to emerge.  The different branches of liberalism are largely distinguished by their contrasting conceptions of liberty. 

Negative liberty, championed by classical liberals, refers to freedom from external interference, particularly by the state. It emphasises the **absence of constraints that would prevent individuals from acting according to their own will**.   

Positive liberty, a core tenant of social liberalism, refers to the freedom to realise one's potential, recognising that meaningful freedom requires not just absence of constraints but also **enabling conditions like education and material resources**. This distinction explains why classical liberals prioritise limiting government power while social liberals support **welfare state programs to create conditions for all to exercise effective freedom**.

Classical Liberalism emerged in the 17th-18th centuries during the struggle against absolutist monarchies and rigid social hierarchies. Thinkers like **[[John Locke]]** developed these ideas in reaction to arbitrary #royal-power, #religious persecution, and #mercantilism. The primary challenge was breaking free from traditional authority structures, making negative liberty (freedom from interference) the natural focus.

**[[Social Liberalism]]** arose in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in response to the problems of industrial [[Capitalism]]. As #industrialisation created widespread urban #poverty and #exploitative working conditions, thinkers like **Green** and **Hobhouse** recognised that formal freedoms meant little to those struggling with material deprivation. This shifted focus toward #positive-liberty and #state-intervention to create conditions for meaningful freedom.

**[[Neoliberalism]]** developed in the mid-20th century as a reaction against expanding state power, #keynesian-economics, and socialist planning. [[Friedrich Hayek]] and **Friedman** advocated #free-market principles during a period when government economic control had significantly expanded, responding to what they saw as threats to #economic-freedom and efficiency.

**[[Libertarianism]]** gained prominence in the late 20th century partly as a response to the growth of the administrative state and perceived #government-overreach. It represented a more #radical response to similar concerns that motivated neoliberals.

## Examples in contemporary developed countries

### World

#### Classical Liberalism - Switzerland
Switzerland embodies classical liberalism through its decentralised governance at three levels (Confederation, cantons, communes), strong direct democracy, and protection of individual liberties while maintaining limited federal intervention in economic affairs.

#### Social Liberalism - Canada & Sweden/Denmark
Canada exemplifies social liberalism through its Medicare system that provides universal healthcare while balancing market economics with social welfare programs. This reflects the core social liberal principle that the state should ensure positive conditions for freedom. [(source)](https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada/Health-and-welfare)

The Nordic model combines comprehensive welfare states with market economies through high taxation funding universal services, strong labor protections, and commitment to equality, while maintaining economic competitiveness.

#### Neoliberalism - United Kingdom (Thatcher Era)
Under Margaret Thatcher (1979-1990), the UK implemented comprehensive neoliberal reforms including privatisation of state enterprises, financial deregulation, reduced trade union power, and monetarist policies to control inflation, fundamentally altering the UK economy.

#### Libertarianism - Argentina (Under Milei)
President Javier Milei (elected 2023) represents libertarian governance through radical economic policies including plans to abolish the central bank, replace the peso with the dollar, and drastically reduce state spending to address Argentina's economic crisis.

### Australiasia

#### Social Liberalism/Neoliberalism (Hawke-Keating Era, 1983-1996)
The Hawke-Keating governments implemented significant market reforms (floating the dollar, financial deregulation, privatisation) while maintaining "Australian Laborism" through the Prices and Incomes Accord with unions, Medicare universal healthcare, progressive taxation, compulsory superannuation, and targeted welfare. This hybrid approach produced lower income inequality than comparable Anglo economies implementing neoliberal reforms.

#### Neoliberalism (Howard Era, 1996-2007)
The Howard government intensified neoliberal policies through further privatisation (Telstra), financial deregulation, the regressive Goods and Services Tax, WorkChoices industrial relations reforms weakening unions, tax cuts favouring higher incomes, and reduced public sector spending.

#### Social Liberalism (Rudd Government, 2007-2010)
The Rudd government implemented Keynesian responses to the 2008 financial crisis with stimulus packages exceeding $52 billion featuring direct payments to households, infrastructure investment, and business tax breaks. Other initiatives included paid parental leave, increased health funding, the National Broadband Network, and carbon pricing. These interventionist policies helped Australia avoid recession during the global downturn.

#### Social Liberalism (Albanese Government, 2022-present)
The Albanese government balances market economics with social investments through inflation reduction measures, wage growth policies, and renewable energy investments. Social programs include expanded Medicare urgent care clinics, housing affordability initiatives, energy bill relief, and targeted support for remote and Indigenous communities. This approach emphasises government's role in ensuring positive conditions for freedom through strategic market interventions.
