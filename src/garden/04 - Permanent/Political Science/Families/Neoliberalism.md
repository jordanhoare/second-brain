A revival of economic liberalism that emerged in the mid-20th century as a reaction against Keynesian economics, state interventionism, and socialist planning. Neoliberalism emphasises #free-market, #deregulation, and limited government.

Neoliberalism gained political influence in the 1970s-80s, particularly through the governments of Margaret Thatcher (UK) and Ronald Reagan (US). Its policies include tax cuts, privatization, deregulation, free trade agreements, and reduced social spending. Critics argue it has increased inequality and economic instability, while supporters credit it with economic growth and efficiency.
