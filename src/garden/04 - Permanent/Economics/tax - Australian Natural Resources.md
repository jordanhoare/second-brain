## ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡´ Norway's Oil and Gas Sector

- In 2023, the combined production value of oil and gas extraction and related services on the Norwegian Continental Shelf was approximately NOK 1,560 billion. After accounting for intermediate consumption (operating costs) of about NOK 187 billion, the estimated **gross operating profit stood at NOK 1,373 billion** (~A$200 billion).

- The **Norwegian government collected NOK 474 billion in petroleum taxes and received NOK 355 billion from dividends** and withdrawals related to state ownership in petroleum activities, totalling NOK 829 billion (~A$120 billion) in petroleum revenues for 2023.

- The **government maintains significant ownership in the oil and gas sector** through entities like Equinor and the [[sdfi - State's Direct Financial Interest]]], allowing direct participation in profits.
- Revenues from taxation and ownership stakes are funneled into the [[gpfg - Government Pension Fund Global]], serving as a **financial buffer for future generations.**

## ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Australia's Mining Sector

- In 2022â€“23, Australia's mining and energy exports reached a record **A$455 billion**. ([source](https://minerals.org.au/resources/mining-delivers-record-455-billion-in-export-revenue-in-fy23))
- The mining sector recorded **gross operating profits of ~A$295 billion** in 2022. ([source](https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Profits-and-Prices-Mining-and-NonMining.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
- Mining companies captured over **80% of their gross value-added as profit**, indicating very high pre-tax profit margins. ([source](https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/surging-mining-sector-profits-are-distorting-australias-economy))
- The sector contributed **A$42.5 billion in corporate taxes** and **A$31.5 billion in royalties**, totalling **A$74 billion in revenue**. ([source](https://mining.com.au/australian-minerals-sector-delivers-record-tax-royalty-payments))
- The [[swf - Future Fund]], Australiaâ€™s sovereign wealth vehicle, is valued at A$304.5 billion but is not resourced from mining or energy revenues. ([source](https://www.futurefund.gov.au/investment-performance))

### Observations

- **Australia collects less than half the share of resource profits** that Norway does, despite similarly high GOP margins in their respective sectors.
- **Applying a 78% tax regime** to profit margins in Australia's resource sector could hypothetically increase government revenue by over **A$100 billion per year**, depending on tax structure and current credit policy restructuring... which is __more than 3Ã— the annual Medicare budget (~A$32 billion) or 2.5Ã— the federal education budget (~A$41 billion)__
- **Redirecting resource revenues to a sovereign wealth fund** would allow long-term fiscal savings via an Australian equivalent of the [[gpfg - Government Pension Fund Global]].
- **Public investment in mining assets** would provide the state with ongoing income and strategic influence in key industries.
