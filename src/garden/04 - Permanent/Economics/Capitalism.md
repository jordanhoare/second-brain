Economists and political theorists usually define #capitalism by three/four baseline features:
1. **Private ownership** of the means of production (factories, tools, capital goods)
2. **Markets and prices** as the primary mechanism for allocating goods, labour, and capital
3. **Wage labour** — people sell their labour to earn income
4. **Profit motive** — investment and innovation are driven by private return
