Norway's [[swf - Sovereign Wealth Fund]] demonstrates a more effective approach:
- Norway ensures **comprehensive resource taxation** that delivers significant public benefit from its natural resources.
- **All petroleum revenues transfer directly to the fund** without political interference or diversion to current spending.
- Clear **fiscal rules limit annual spending to 3% of fund value**, preventing short-term political raids on the fund.
- The fund **invests exclusively outside Norway** to avoid domestic economic distortion and currency appreciation.
