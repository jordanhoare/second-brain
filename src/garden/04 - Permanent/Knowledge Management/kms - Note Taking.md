# Hybrid Zettelkasten-PARA System in Obsidian

## Core Philosophy

My digital garden/second brain in Obsidian combines the atomic note structure of #Zettelkasten with the organisational clarity of #PARA to create a system that's both flexible for idea connection and practical for project #management.

## Note Types

1. **Fleeting Notes**
    - Quick captures of high-level ideas
    - Minimal structure, meant to be processed later
    - Function as seeds for permanent notes
2. **Literature Notes**
    - Captures of external knowledge from others
    - Includes source references, quotes, and personal #reflections
    - Processed into permanent notes with connections to my own thinking
3. **Permanent Notes**
    - Refined, atomic ideas developed from #fleeting and #literature notes
    - Written in my own words with clear connections to other notes
    - Heavily linked within the knowledge graph

## Organizational Structure (PARA)

1. **Projects**
    - Time-bound activities with specific deliverables and due dates
    - Each project has its own directory with relevant notes linked
    - Projects notes connect to permanent notes that inform them
2. **Areas**
    - Broader than projects, representing continuous interests
    - Serve as containers for related permanent notes and status updates etc..
3. **Resources**
    - References to external works that inspire or inform my work
    - Structured as literature notes but organized topically
    - Connected to relevant permanent notes and projects
4. **Archives**
    - Completed projects or inactive areas
    - Preserved for reference but removed from active workspaces
    - Still connected in the knowledge graph for future discovery

## Additional Components

1. **Journal**
    - Daily reflections and thought processing
    - Captures shower thoughts and initial reactions to information
    - Acts as a feeder system for fleeting notes or essays later on
2. **Maps of Content (MOCs)**
    - Curated collections of links to related notes
    - Provide navigational structure through the knowledge base
    - Help identify patterns and gaps in thinking

## Workflow

1. Capture fleeting thoughts in daily journal (philosophical in nature) or fleeting notes (professional or educational in nature)
2. Process external information into literature notes
3. Develop permanent notes from digesting fleeting and literature notes
4. Organise active work in projects and areas
5. Create maps of content to navigate the system
6. Archive completed work while maintaining connections
