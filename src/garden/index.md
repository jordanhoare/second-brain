## title: "Second Brain"

# Welcome to My Second Brain

This digital garden represents the interconnected collection of my thoughts, notes, and ideas across software development, philosophy, and personal reflections.

## What You'll Find Here

This space serves as both a personal knowledge repository and a public exploration of ideas. As a software developer with interests in philosophy and personal growth, I've created this second brain to:

- Document technical knowledge and development insights
- Explore philosophical concepts and questions (aka... my shower thoughts)
- Connect seemingly unrelated ideas into new insights

## Navigation

The content here follows a [[zettelkasten]] approach - small, interconnected notes that build upon each other. Feel free to:

- Browse by [[tags]] or [[_notes]] to explore topics
- Check out my [[_projects]] to see what I'm currently working on
- Read my [[_journal]] for time-based reflections and my shower thoughts
- Follow links between notes to discover connections

## Recent Notes

## About This Site

This digital garden is built using [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) and follows the principles of networked thought. Unlike traditional blogs, you're encouraged to wander and explore connections rather than following a linear path.

The repository is open source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jordanhoare/second-brain).
