# Welcome to My Second Brain

This digital garden represents the interconnected collection of my thoughts, notes, and ideas across software development, philosophy, and personal reflections.

## What You'll Find Here

This space serves as both a personal knowledge repository and a public exploration of ideas. As a software developer with interests in philosophy and personal growth, I've created this second brain to:

- Document technical knowledge and development insights
- Explore philosophical concepts and questions (aka... my shower thoughts)
- Connect seemingly unrelated ideas into new insights

## Navigation

The content here follows a [[zettelkasten]] approach - small, interconnected notes that build upon each other. Feel free to:

- Browse by tagsor [[_notes]] to explore topics
- Check out my [[_projects]]] to see what I'm currently working on
- Read my [[_journal]] for time-based reflections and my shower thoughts
- Follow links between notes to discover connections
