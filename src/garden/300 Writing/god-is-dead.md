> God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it?

Freud's observation that humanity has "become a god by means of artificial limbs" echoes Nietzsche's famous declaration that "God is dead." We have not only killed the divine through our scientific and technological advancement, but have attempted to assume the vacant throne ourselves. Our digital devices, constant connectivity, and algorithmic recommendations—these are the "artificial limbs" through which we exercise our newfound godhood.

Yet Nietzsche warned of the void left by God's death—the collapse of absolute meaning and values. Perhaps our desperate avoidance of boredom reflects this existential vacuum. We fill every moment with consumption of ideas and validation not merely for pleasure or advancement, but to avoid confronting the fundamental meaninglessness that Nietzsche identified as the consequence of God's death.

In this light, boredom becomes not just uncomfortable but threatening—a state in which we might glimpse the abyss that underlies our frantic activity. Without external stimulation, we risk facing Nietzsche's terrifying freedom: the responsibility to create meaning in a universe that offers none inherently.

What's particularly striking is how self-improvement culture often functions as a secular religion, complete with its own prophets, rituals, and promises of salvation and riches. Having killed God, we've created countless substitute deities—optimisation, productivity, wellness and fitness—that demand their own forms of devotion while delivering only temporary relief from the underlying void.
