Today I caught myself falling into a familiar trap. I spent hours researching the "perfect" Obsidian setup—comparing plugins, examining folder structures, and watching tutorial videos on ideal workflows. I was convinced that finding the optimal system would somehow transform my productivity and thinking.

Three hours in, the irony struck me: I was once again just consuming rather than creating. I was so focused on building the perfect system for capturing thoughts that I wasn't actually having any thoughts worth capturing. The tool had become more important than its purpose.

I finally closed my browser, opened a blank note in Obsidian, and just started writing. The setup wasn't perfect, but my thoughts flowed more freely than they had all day. Sometimes the simplest approach is the most effective—a lesson I seem destined to learn repeatedly.

Just a gentle reminder to myself... nothing is stopping me just tweaking things as I progress - and some days, it's okay to just go through the motions.
