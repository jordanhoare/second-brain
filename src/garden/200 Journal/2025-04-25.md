```dataviewjs
const today = dv.date('2025-04-25')
const lifespan = { year: 80 }
const birthday = DateTime.fromObject({
  year: 1996,
  month: 11,
  day: 12
});
const deathday = birthday.plus(lifespan)
function progress(type) {
  let value;
  switch(type) {
    case "lifespan":
      value = (today.year - birthday.year) / lifespan.year * 100;
      break;
  }
  return `<span style="font-weight: 600; font-size: 1em; margin-right: 15px;">Memento Mori</span><progress value="${parseInt(value)}" max="100" style="vertical-align: middle;"></progress> &nbsp;&nbsp; ${parseInt(value)}%`
}
dv.span(progress("lifespan"))
```
