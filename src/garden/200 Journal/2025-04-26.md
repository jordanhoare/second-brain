> A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. He may as well concern himself with his shadow on the wall. Speak what you think now in hard words, and to-morrow speak what to-morrow thinks in hard words again, though it contradict every thing you said to-day. — 'Ah, so you shall be sure to be misunderstood.' — Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates, and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood.

Emerson's words challenge us to value authentic expression over consistency for its own sake. It suggests that our thoughts naturally evolve, and that being willing to contradict our past selves is not a weakness but potentially a sign of growth and intellectual honesty.  

Self-reliance highlights the importance of honouring your inner voice above external expectations. It often acts as a reminder of the gaps we've developed between authentic self and the persona we play due to external pressures and fear of misunderstanding. When we consistently act in ways that aren't aligned with our core values, it creates a kind of internal friction that depletes our energy and sense of purpose - often resulting in burnout or distress.

I want to separate identity from occupation and the social roles assigned by convention. A true self should emerge from moments of isolation, boredom, and contemplation—not from external influences and pressures.  

I feel drawn back to transcendentalist ideals that emphasise the inherent goodness of humanity and the importance of intuition and spiritual insight. The disgust I feel toward consumerism and social media obsessions points to deeper values:
- cultivating my authentic self and creative spirit
- trusting my own intuition and instincts rather than blindly following societal norms
- living in accordance with my own principles rather than battling mental distress by appeasing others

At my core, I am deeply introspective. I find joy in daily contemplation of ideas from 17th, 18th, and 19th century authors, yet I've neglected this practice for too long. This intellectual exploration isn't just a distraction from work—it's a happy, creative space that provides perspective on myself and the world around me.

Most importantly, I value an "original relation to the universe"—that connection to something greater, whether understood through spiritual or scientific means. Regular writing and meditation practices could help me reconnect with this pantheistic sense of belonging, while studies in cosmology, chemistry, and physics remind me that we all stem from the same stardust.

The journey back to authenticity begins with this recognition: the values were never truly lost, only temporarily obscured by the personas I've constructed in response to a world that too often rewards conformity over truth.
