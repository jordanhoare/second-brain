# Journal

This is where I capture daily reflections, shower thoughts, and evolving ideas that haven't yet crystallized into formal notes.

## Purpose

My journal entries serve as:

- A capture system for fleeting thoughts
- A space for philosophical exploration or venting
- A record of my evolving thinking process

## Recent Entries

- [[2025-04-24]] - Thoughts on journaling, notetaking and original ideas
